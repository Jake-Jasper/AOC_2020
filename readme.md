# My attempt at Advent of Code 2020

Just trying the puzzles in my own time. I will try and solve them all on my own until I come across a concept I have never seen before and then I will look at other peoples solutions.

I am just trying to solve the problems, I don't care about optimising my solutions at this point, perhaps later.

As I am in the UK, I won't even be attempting to get on the leaderboard as that would mean missing a lot of sleep. I am just doing the puzzles as and when I feel like it.

## [Day 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/day1_2.py)

Simple for loops.

## [Day 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/day2_2.py)

Looping again

## Day 3 [Part 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D3_1.py) [Part 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D3_2.py)

Implementing wrap-around when looping through a list, I haven't done this before, so that was interesting.

## Day 4 [Part 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D4_1.py) [Part 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D4_2.py)

The first part was faily simple (for me) with a little bit of regex. However, part 2 took me for ever. This is because there were lots of conditions that needed to be met, and I didn't get it right the first time so it took me ages to debug - I almost gave up!

I didn't learn anything new from this one but I did do something new, which was chain laods of and statements together, previously I think 3 was my max.

## Day 5
