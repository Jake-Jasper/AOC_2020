# My attempt at Advent of Code 2020

Just trying the puzzles in my own time. I will try and solve them all on my own until I come across a concept I have never seen before and then I will look at other peoples solutions.

I am just trying to solve the problems, I don't care about optimising my solutions at this point, perhaps later.

As I am in the UK, I won't even be attempting to get on the leaderboard as that would mean missing a lot of sleep. I am just doing the puzzles as and when I feel like it.

## [Day 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/day1_2.py)

Simple for loops.

## [Day 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/day2_2.py)

Looping again

## Day 3 [Part 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D3_1.py) [Part 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D3_2.py)

Implementing wrap-around when looping through a list, I haven't done this before, so that was interesting.

## Day 4 [Part 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D4_1.py) [Part 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D4_2.py)

The first part was faily simple (for me) with a little bit of regex. However, part 2 took me for ever. This is because there were lots of conditions that needed to be met, and I didn't get it right the first time so it took me ages to debug - I almost gave up!

I didn't learn anything new from this one but I did do something new, which was chain laods of and statements together, previously I think 3 was my max.

## Day 5  [Part 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D5_1.py)

Despite knowing that the problem requires knowledge of binary, and knowing that I know next to nothing about binary, I attempted the problem anyway. Just by uisng the knoweldge I have. Solving the first problem was trivial, I am sure the second one was doable without knowledge of binary, but I did not understand what the problem statement was trying to tell me. Treating this sort of like an exam I had to skip here. I should not be awarded a star for this by my own logic. However, I will go and study binary and see how the problem should be solved.

## Day 6  [Part 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D6_1.py) [Part 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D6_2.py)

I found the first one very easy, was achievable with a oneliner. But as is becoming the standard, the second one took me hours. I didn't have the knowledge to do it succinctly so I struggled for a while, before learning about this operator '&=' which is essentially the intersection operator if my understanding is correct. So it was useful for taking the common elements in two lists.

I hope I can remember this the next time the situation comes up.

## Day 7

The first day where I could not do at least the first part. I did not know about graph data structures and I feel like this one was a hard version of graph datastructures.

## Day 8

[Part 1](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D8_1.py)  [Part 2](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D8_2.py)

I found the first part easy, and completed it within ~ 5mins, but I could not complete the second part, I think I am off by one somewhere and I have spent hours debugging it to no avail. I have set myself a cutoff so i don't waste too much time. But I am sure it is almost complete. I am 100% sure if I re wrote it entirely I could complete it but I have spent to much time on it. Time to move on.

## Day 9

[Part 1](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D9_1.py)  [Part 2](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D9_2.py)

Part 1 was fairly easy, assuming you know about combinations! Part 2 was also quite easy with a brute force, the way I did it. Although I knew as I was writing it it would be suboptimal. I learnt the sliding window algorithm from asottille which ran wayyyy faster. So this was a good day for me.

## Day 10
[Part 1](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D10_1.py)  [Part 2](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D10_2.py)

I found understanding the first problem difficult to understand, I just worked backwards from the example given, it did not really understand the text.

and then the problem was simple.

The reverse was true for part 2. Easy to understnad, difficult to solve. And I didn't solve it on my own, I had to look it up. I did learn that there was such thing as a tribonacci sequence though!

But at my current stage of learning I would not have figured out the solution to part 2 without help.

## Day 11


[Part 1](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D11_1.py)  [Part 2](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D10_2.py)

So, I did not complete this one, my solution worked with the test-case, but was off by 13 on my problem input. I may return to this as I liked my "solution". I used a convolution method which was the the only method I could think of.


# At this point I stopped playing and didn't come back to the problems until January, so from now on, I am taking my time with the oroblems.

## Day 12
[Part 1](https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D12_1.py)

Onwards!


## Things to learn for next time
- Binary 
- Graph datastructures
- Improve regex
