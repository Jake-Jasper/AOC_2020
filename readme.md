# My attempt at Advent of Code 2020

Just trying the puzzles in my own time. I will try and solve them all on my own until I come across a concept I have never seen before and then I will look at other peoples solutions.

I am just trying to solve the problems, I don't care about optimising my solutions at this point, perhaps later.


## [Day 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/day1_2.py)

Simple for loops.

## [Day 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/day2_2.py)

Looping again

## Day 3 [Part 1](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D3_1.py) [Part 2](#https://github.com/Jake-Jasper/AOC_2020/blob/main/D3_2.py)

Implementing wrap-around when looping through a list, I haven't done this before, so that was interesting.
